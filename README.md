SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

# Proposed Solution

## Detailed explanation of the proposed solution :

- The proposed solution is a Digital Farm Management Portal designed to integrate biosecurity practices into everyday farm operations. It will serve as a one-stop platform for farmers, veterinarians, and policymakers.

##  How it addresses the problem :

- Provides localized risk assessment tools to identify vulnerabilities in pig and poultry farms

- Offers interactive training modules to educate farmers on best practices

- Ensures regulatory compliance tracking to support disease-free compartment recognition

- Delivers real-time alerts on outbreaks and breaches, enabling rapid response

- Promotes collaboration among stakeholders through networking features


## Innovation and uniqueness of the solution :

- Mobile-first, multilingual design ensures accessibility in rural areas

- AI-driven risk assessment tailored to local epidemiological data

- Blockchain-based compliance tracking for secure and transparent record-keeping

- IoT integration for real-time monitoring of farm conditions



# Technical Approach :

## Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware) :

- Frontend: React.js / Angular (for responsive UI)

- Backend: Node.js / Django (for scalable APIs)

- Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

- Mobile App: Flutter / React Native

- AI/ML Models: Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) for risk prediction

- IoT Integration: Sensors for farm monitoring (temperature, humidity, livestock movement)

- Blockchain: Smart contracts for compliance tracking

## Methodology & Process :

- Requirement Analysis – Identify farmer needs and regulatory frameworks

- System Design – Architecture planning with modular components

- Prototype Development – Build core features (risk assessment, training modules)

- Testing & Validation – Pilot with selected farms

- Deployment – Rollout mobile-first platform

- Monitoring & Feedback – Continuous improvement based on farmer input

# Feasibility and Viability : 

## Analysis of the feasibility of the idea :

- High feasibility due to availability of open-source technologies and mobile penetration in rural India

- Viable as it aligns with government priorities on livestock health and disease prevention
- 
## Potential challenges and risks :

- Limited digital literacy among farmers

- Connectivity issues in remote areas

- Resistance to adopting new technologies
- 
## Strategies for overcoming these challenges :

- Training workshops and extension services for farmers

- Offline functionality with periodic sync when internet is available

- Incentive programs to encourage adoption

# Impact and Benefits :

## Potential impact on the target audience :

- Strengthened biosecurity practices at farm level

- Reduced risk of disease outbreaks and economic losses

- Improved national preparedness for zoonotic diseases
## Benefits of the solution (social, economic, environmental, etc.) :

- Social: Empowerment of smallholder farmers

- Economic: Increased productivity and reduced losses

- Environmental: Sustainable livestock management practices

- Policy: Data-driven decision-making for authorities
